Welcome to CCA Manager's User Guide! CCA Manager is a **contact manager designed to simplify the management of CCAs and enhance your administrative efficiency**, regardless of whether you're overseeing a sports team, academic club, any other extracurricular activity, or simply a CCA participant. It has a minimal and intuitive [_Graphic User Interface_](#glossary) where most actions are performed via commands, making it a pleasure to use. If you can type fast, CCA Manager can get your admin tracking done faster than traditional [_Graphic User Interface_](#glossary) apps.

In this user guide, we'll walk you through the essential steps to harness the full potential of CCA Manager. Whether you're a CCA Executive Committee Member or simply a CCA participant, our guide will provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to make the most of our app.

This user guide does assumes some prior experience with administrative tools and command interfaces. Don't worry if you don't know these, we'll guide you along the way! If you have further questions while reading this document or while using our app, visit our [FAQ](#faq). If your question isn't answered there, feel free to visit our [project repository](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/issues) and raise an issue.

This user guide is split into 4 parts:
1. [An introduction to what CCA Manager offers](#product-introduction),
2. [An installation guide and a quick start](#installation-guide),
3. [An overview of all the features of CCA Manager](#features), and
4. [An FAQ](#faq).

Managing contact information and roles for members of CCAs can be a cumbersome task, often involving disparate tools and platforms. Administrators face challenges in efficiently organizing members, coordinating activities, and communicating effectively within these groups.

For instance, the management of contact information and associated information about a CCA activity often involves the use of the following apps: Discord, Telegram, Google Spreadsheets, Sessionize, etc. This makes maintaining administrative information messy, often involving several steps to accomplish a simple task.

CCA Manager endeavors to equip CCAs with tools that streamline administration, freeing up valuable time for more meaningful tasks. We do so by providing a unified solution in the form of the following core features:

1. **Centralized CCA Membership Management**: Easily associate members with their respective CCAs within one app, eliminating the need for multiple platforms.
2. **Efficient Group Actions**: Perform actions on groups of CCA members, such as searching for multiple CCAs at once, and streamlining administrative tasks.
3. **Role Assignment**: Assign roles to CCA members, enhancing organization and clarity within the group.

To get started with CCA Manager and explore its features further, check out our [Installation Guide](#installation-guide) and our [Quick Start](#quick-start), where we'll go through some concrete use cases for our app.

(Reminder: the **green link** means it has relevant explanations in the [_Glossary_](#glossary). `^_^` )

## Installation Guide

**This Installation guide targets an audience who has knowledge of how to install programs and how to use a command line/terminal.**

<!-- TODO: Make the above disclaimer redundant -->

1. Ensure you have [_Java_](#glossary) `11` or above installed on your Computer.

1. Download the latest `ccamanager.jar` from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases). (Click [_here_](#glossary) if you don't know what is `.jar`)

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your CCA Manager.

1. On [**_Linux_**](#glossary) and [**_macOS_**](#glossary):
   1. Open a [_command terminal_](#glossary).
   1. Type `cd <folder>` into the terminal and press `enter`, where you replace `<folder>` with the path to the folder where you've placed `ccamanager.jar`. This navigates the terminal to the correct folder.
   1. Type `java -jar ccamanager.jar` into the terminal and press `enter` to run the application. <br>

1. On [**_Windows_**](#glossary):
    1. Double-click the `ccamanager.jar` file to run it.

**A [_Graphic User Interface_](#glossary) similar to below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.**<br>

## Quick Start

Confused about where to get started? Don’t fret, in this section, we'll outline how to use CCA Manager to its maximum effect with a few scenarios.

First off, CCA Manager's interface consists of the following main components:

<center>
<img src="images/CommandLine.png" >
</center>

1. **Command Box**: A small text box where you type the commands.
3. **Output Box**: Displays any errors that might have occurred, or other information about the most recent command executed.
2. **Results Box**: Displays the results of the command.


All of CCA Manager's functionality is accessed via commands. This includes both adding and editing contacts, as well as accessing existing contacts.

### Upon Booting Up

When you first boot up the app, the app will contain some example contacts for you to get a feel of using CCA Manager's functions.

To run a command, type the command in the **Command Box** and press Enter to execute it. For example, typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.

Here are some other example commands you can try:
   * `list`: [Lists all contacts.](#listing-all-persons-list)
   * `delete 3`: [Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the currently displayed list.](#deleting-a-person-delete)
   * `filter c/NUS Cycling`: [Filter contacts by CCA.](#filter-by-cca-and-roles-filter)
   * `exit`: [Exits the app.](#exiting-the-program-exit)
   <!--* `add`: [Adds a contact/CCA group to the CCA Manager](#add-contacts-with-cca-labels)-->
   <!--* `edit`: [Edit details of the contacts.](#edit-the-details-of-your-contacts)-->

<box type="info"><md>
**Information:**

* `Index of person` **must be a number greater than 0**.
* **At least one** of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
</md></box>

<box type="tip"><md>
**Tip:**

* To remove all Roles of a person, use `r/nil`.
* To remove all CCAs of a person, use `c/nil`.
</md></box>

<box type="warning"><md>
**Warning:**

* When editing Roles, (E.g., `edit 1 r/new role`), the existing Roles of the person **will be removed**. I.e., editing of Roles is **not cumulative**.
</md></box>

##### Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com`
    * Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 r/nil`
    * Removes all Roles of the 2nd person.
* `edit 1 c/NUS Rollers c/NUS Origami`
    * Edits the CCAs of the 2nd person to be `NUS Rollers` and `NUS Origami`.

##### Outcome:

Suppose we start with this list of people displayed in the **Results Box**.

<center>
<img src="images/editcommandoutcome1.png" >
</center>

We then run the following command:

```
edit 2 c/NUS Rollers c/NUS Origami
```

<center>
<img src="images/editcommandoutcome2.png" >
</center>

The 2nd person on the list, Bernice Yu, has her CCAs updated from `NUS Cycling` to both `NUS Origami` and `NUS Rollers`.

##### Possible Failures:

+ The [_Index of person_](#glossary) must be within range. I.e., it must be greater than 0, and smaller than the length of the currently displayed list of people. This is because the [_Index of person_](#glossary) will be used to indicate which person to operate the command on.

#### Track a person owing money: `owe`

Set up the amount of money a person owes.

##### Command Format:

$$
\large
\overbrace{\texttt{\colorbox{lightgrey}{owe}}}
    ^{\text{\colorbox{lightgrey}{Action}}}
\quad
\overbrace{\texttt{\fcolorbox{tomato}{transparent}{\color{green}{1}}}}
    ^{\substack{
        \text{\colorbox{gold}{Index of person}} \\
        \text{\colorbox{gold}{in \textbf{Result Box}}}
    }}
\quad

<img src="images/UG-Basics/owe-output-1.png" >
</center>

##### Possible Failures:


- The [_Index of person_](#glossary) must be within range.
+ The amount of money provided `m/` must also be numeric and in dollars, and cannot exceed 2 decimal places. For example, the following are invalid for the amount:
    + `m/one dollar`: Not numeric.
    + `m/10.001`: More than 2 decimal places.

#### Charge a person with money: `charge`
Charge a person with an amount of money by CCA and optionally, by role.

##### Command Format:

$$
\large
\overbrace{\texttt{\colorbox{lightgrey}{charge}}}
    ^{\text{\colorbox{lightgrey}{Action}}}
\quad
\overbrace{\texttt{\colorbox{aquamarine}{m/}\color{green}{10.00}}}
    ^{\text{\colorbox{aquamarine}{Amount to charge}}}
\quad
\underset{
    \substack{
        \text{\color{red}{must have at least one}} \\
        \text{\color{red}{can have multiple}}
    }
}{
    \overbrace{\texttt{\colorbox{plum}{c/}\color{green}{NUS Cycling}}}
        ^{\text{\colorbox{plum}{CCA(s)}}}
}
\quad
\underset{
        \substack{
            \text{\color{red}{Optional}} \\
            \text{\color{red}{can have multiple}}
        }
    }{
        \overbrace{\texttt{\colorbox{lavender}{r/}\color{green}{Treasurer}}}
            ^{\text{\colorbox{lavender}{Role(s)}}}
    }
$$

<box type="info"><md>
**Information:**

The people who will be charged are people who are:
1. In any of the CCAs provided, **AND**
2. In any of the roles provided.
</md></box>

<box type="tip"><md>
**Tip:**

To see who will be charged by a command, say via `charge m/10.00 c/NUS Cycling r/Logistics`, run the [`filter` command](#filter-by-cca-and-roles-filter). In this case, `filter c/NUS Cycling r/Logistics` will display the people that will be charged.
</md></box>

##### Examples:

* `charge m/10.00 c/NUS Cycling r/Treasurer`
    * Charges all members in `NUS Cycling` with the role of `Treasurer`

##### Outcome:

For `charge m/10.00 c/NUS Cycling r/Treasurer`:
<center>
<img src="images/UG-Basics/charge-output-1.png" >
</center>

##### Possible Failures:

+ The amount of money provided `m/` must also be numeric and in dollars, and cannot exceed 2 decimal places. I.e., the following are invalid for the amount:
    + `m/one dollar`: Not numeric.
    + `m/10.001`: More than 2 decimal places.
+ If nobody is charged, the command will fail. This might be caused by nobody in the contact list fulfilling both the CCAs and the Roles provided to the command.

$$
\large
\overbrace{\texttt{\colorbox{lightgrey}{setatt}}}
    ^{\text{\colorbox{lightgrey}{Action}}}
\quad
\overbrace{\texttt{\fcolorbox{tomato}{transparent}{\color{green}{1}}}}
    ^{\substack{
        \text{\colorbox{gold}{Index of person}} \\
        \text{\colorbox{gold}{in \textbf{Result Box}}}
    }}
\quad
\overbrace{\texttt{\colorbox{aquamarine}{att/}\color{green}{3}}}
    ^{\substack{
        \text{\colorbox{aquamarine}{Number of attended}} \\
        \text{\colorbox{aquamarine}{sessions}
    }}}
\quad
\overbrace{\texttt{\colorbox{aquamarine}{s/}\color{green}{10}}}
    ^{\text{\colorbox{aquamarine}{Number of sessions}}}
$$


##### Examples:

* `setatt 2 att/4 s/6`
    * Sets the attendance of the second person in the **Result Box** to be `4/6`. I.e., that they have attended 4 out of a total of 6 sessions.

##### Outcome:

<img src="images/UG-Basics/outcomeSetatt1.png" >
<img src="images/UG-Basics/outcomeSetatt2.png" >

##### Possible Failures:

- If the number of sessions attended (`att/`) exceeds the number of sessions total `s/`, the application will error out.
- The [_Index of person_](#glossary) must be within range.

#### Delete a CCA: `cca_delete`
Delete a current existing CCA

##### Command Format:

$$
\large
\overbrace{\texttt{\colorbox{lightgrey}{cca\_delete}}}
    ^{\text{\colorbox{lightgrey}{Action}}}
\quad
\overbrace{\texttt{\colorbox{plum}{c/}\color{green}{NUS Cycling}}}
        ^{\text{\colorbox{plum}{CCA to delete}}}
$$

<box type="info"><md>
**Info:**

* This command will remove the selected CCA from every person in the CCA, but will not delete the person.
* After running this command, CCA Manager will only list contacts of the deleted CCA. Type the `list` command again to see all contacts.
</md></box>

##### Examples:

* `cca_delete c/NUS Cycling`
* `cca_delete c/Jogging`

##### Outcome:

Suppose we start with this list of people displayed in the **Results Box**.

<img src="images/UG-Basics/outcomeCca_deleteBefore.png" >

We then run the following command:

```
cca_delete c/NUS Cycling
```

<img src="images/UG-Basics/outcomeCca_deleteAfter1.png" >

Notice that the CCA of the person `Caleb Hugh` has been removed.

##### Possible Failures:

+ If the CCA specified to the command does not exist, the command will fail as there is nothing to delete.

### Storage

The following features are documented in this section:
* [Editing the data file](#editing-the-data-file)
* [Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`](#archiving-data-files-coming-in-v2-0)

{% set navigationlinks = [
    {name: "Table of Contents", url: "#table-of-contents"},
    {name: "Features", url: "#features"},
    {name: "Storage", url: "#storage"}
]%}

<box type="info"><md>
**Information**: CCA Manager data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.
</md></box>

#### Editing the data file

CCA Manager data are saved automatically as a [_JSON_](#glossary) file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning"><md>
**Warning:**

If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, CCA Manager will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the CCA Manager to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</md></box>

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the [_Graphic User Interface_](#glossary) will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

## Command summary

<box type="info"><md>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

<!-- TODO: Replace this to fit the actual documentation properly  -->
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter that can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [r/ROLE]` can be used as `n/John Doe r/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[r/ROLE]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `r/friend`, `r/friend r/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
