# CCA Manager User Guide ‚ÑπÔ∏è

CCA Manager is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a  Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CCA Manager can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

**Notes about the command format:**<br>
> [!NOTE]
> 1. Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
>
>    For example, `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
>
>
> 2. Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
>
>    For example, `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
>
>
> 3. Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
>
>    For example, `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
>
>
> 4. Parameters can be in any order.<br>
>
>    For example, if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
>
>
> 5. Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
>
>    For example, if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous CCA Manager home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
